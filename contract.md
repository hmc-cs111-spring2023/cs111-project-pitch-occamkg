# Contract

## Goals

In terms of the project results, I really hope to be able to create at least a
framework for a language I can use to create more dynamic presentations.
The main motivation for this project is that I find the current softwares for
creating presentations limiting and dull, so I would like to be able to make
something that can be used to create more helpful visuals that flow together
more seamlessly.
Additionally, when creating presentations, I can be a bit pedantic about
whether things are centered or aligned and get frustrated when the software
requires I drag components with pixel precision to actually make them correctly
aligned.
Thus, I hope the language I create can make it easier to place components
precisely with the desired constraints.
I hope the language will be similar enough to other web development languages
(primarily CSS and JavaScript) to make it easy for people familiar with web
design to understand and use.
This way, it could be quickly picked up by others with a lower barrier of entry
than a completely new language, and additionally, it could use syntax that has
been tested and reviewed by millions over many years which would help ensure
that it is usable for a wide audience.

In terms of the skills I develop, I primarily want to better hone my ability to
make a syntax that is intuitive and concise.
Any language, no matter how powerful, could be effectively useless if the syntax
isn't something that users can understand and enjoy using.
Thus, to me this seems like the most important skill to develop in terms of
making DSLs.
In addition to developing clean syntax, I hope to improve my ability to convert
a syntax to my desired output in a straightforward and elegant way.
I really enjoyed this part of the previous assignment and I hope to explore more
ways of interpreting structurally complex syntaxes that I may create.

## Concepts / skills

Two things I especially want to work on are parsing unique syntaxes and
interpreting the parsed syntax into the desired output.
For parsing, I enjoyed working with the basic syntaxes we developed for the
previous homework, but I am curious what additional functionality I will have to
learn for this larger project with a syntax that will continually grow and
change as I add and modify design features.
Additionally, since I don't plan to use Scala as my host language, I will be
exploring how parsing works in other languages and am curious to see the
differences.

For interpreting, I found it difficult, but rewarding to find an intermediate
representation that best fits the output of my program.
For this project, I plan to have output in multiple languages (HTML, CSS, and
JS) which are all related, but definitely distinct.
This could definitely make the job of interpreting more complicated and make it
more difficult to find an IR that is well suited for converting parts to all
three of these languages, but I am excited for the challenge.

## Time management plan

Time management is one of my weaknesses, so this may be a harder part of the
assignment.
Luckily, this semester I don't have any other major assignments due on Mondays
which means I can be focused on this project on the weekends.
Although I may not always be able to get everything done by midnight, I always
have Monday morning and will make sure to get what I want done before class.

For milestones, I hope to have a working very simple test case next week which
means I will have to figure out a basic syntax, setup how to interpret it, and
start making functions to output the desired files.
For each of the following weeks, I hope to add at least two unique features that
distinguish this program from other presentation programs.
I'm really not sure how much time each step will take, so after starting the
programming, I very well may have to revise these milestones to make them more
feasible or more challenging.

## Critique plan

Firstly and most importantly, I will make sure to come to class every Monday so
I can hear the ideas of the person/group I plan to give feedback to.
Although there will be written explanations, it will really help if I can engage
with them in real-time and ask questions and hear their opinions of my
suggestions.
If, for any reason, I cannot make it to class, I will message my feedback
partner to see if they would like to discuss their project progress or not
outside of class.

I will try to work on the feedback Monday evenings while the ideas are still
fresh in my mind.
Additionally, this will help me avoid being distracted by all the other things I
have due Tuesday nights/Wednesday morning.
I will make sure to carefully read through my feedback partner's write-ups and
do any additional searching I may need to do.
I hope to ensure my feedback is helpful by providing the primary insights I may
have in as clear and concise a response as I can.

## Success

The basic result I want to create by the end of the semester is a program that
can interpret a unique (and hopefully more fluent) syntax and output web files
that resemble presentation formats and functions.
By itself, however, this would just be reinventing the wheel, so I also hope to
be able to add at least three features that are not conventional or maybe not
even possible in most presentation creation softwares.
One major feature I want to add is the ability to move around complex diagrams
with adaptive zoom-ins and smooth transitions to other diagram components.
Another more straightforward feature I hope to add is the ability to change the
style of components (like transparency level, size, color, etc.) at keyframes
rather than only having the option to make it visible/invisible.

More broadly, I want to have a framework that I can work off of after this class
and continually add new features to as they are needed.
I do hope I can actually use the program I create to make more unique and
engaging presentations whether I reach that point by the end of this class or
after.
I do, however, hope to have a working (although likely limited) version by the
end of this class that I can use to explain what I've done on this project.

## Assessment

I would base my project grading off of two parts: effort and features.
I would consider an A- to result from putting in a steady, but not necessarily
enthusiastic amount of effort in (like 4-5 hours) and creating about 2-3 unique
presentation features.
I would consider an A to result from putting in a substantial effort (6+ hours)
and creating 4+ unique features.
I'm really not sure if this is reasonable given the time, but it seems doable
and most in line with what I want to get out of the project.
